hotspot_evil

This is a library that exposes the internals of Oracle (Sun)'s HotSpot VM.
It uses unverifiable bytecode sequences to do some really evil stuff, like
reinterpret_cast<>, memory address/dereference, accessing non-visible symbols,
and the like.

Most funtionality is only known to work on Oracle HotSpot VM.

Use JRuby 1.4.0/BiteScript 0.0.5 to generate *.class files from *.java files.
The *.java files in src/ruby directory are actually JRuby source files.
